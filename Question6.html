    <p>The Way of Kings is significantly more complicated than Brandon Sanderson's other novels. Specifically his mistborn series. The way of kings is part one of what will become a 10 book epic. Whereas the mistborn series was originally meant as a trilogy. This means that the way of kings is able to focus on a massive geographical region and extensive detail in religion, magic, culture, and science. Where instead mistborn is more focused on the relationship between characters, magic, and politics, leaving other details out of the spotlight. Both focus heavily upon the growth of characters. For example, <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> becomes a slave very early on in the story and is wrestling with trauma and depression and grows to become a fantastic leader. Similar to Vin’s story in Mistborn, where she goes from being a distrusting street scum to a trusted goddess-like savior. Where the way of kings magic is focused on personal ideals (as far as i can gather, im ¾ of the way into this book and still don't fully know what the magic actually is), Mistborn's magic system is incredibly scientific and based on metals and eating them (sounds strange but is actually really cool). Thematically the way of kings explores concepts like trauma, redemption through responsibility, leadership, personal reality vs public expectation. Versus mistborn focusing on oppression and rebellion, trust and betrayal, power and reverence. And in terms of style, the way of kings is slow, expansive, detailed, and shows the full story. Where Mistborn is rapid, full of twists and turns, detailed yet leaving some areas to be told instead of shown.
        <br>Both of these novels/series are perfect in my opinion. Very different, but both holding your attention the entire time, and keeping you very interested (at least for a nerd like me)

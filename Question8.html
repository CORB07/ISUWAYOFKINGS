    <h1>Question 8: How is the setting important to the novel?</h1>
    <p>The setting in the way of kings has a massive impact on the story. From the magic system, to the actual plot, the settings have an effect.     </p>
    <h2>Magic</h2>
    <img src="Szeth.png" alt="Szeth" class="Image">
    <p>Without the setting the magic system would not be possible. The continent of <a href="Roshar.html">Roshar</a> is victim to massive <a href="Roshar.html">Highstorms</a>. These storms imbue objects with Stormlight. Characters like <a href="Szeth.html">Szeth</a> can then absorb the energy from stormlight and use it to alter things. Szeth can <a href="Magic.html">surgebind</a>, meaning he can alter the laws of gravity on an object or person, including himself. This is how he runs on walls.     </p>

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>This whole story is during the war between two of the nations on the continent of <a href="Roshar.html">Roshar</a>. This war takes place on the <a href="Roshar.html">shattered plains</a>. A series of plateaus and canyons formed by the <a href="Roshar.html">highstorms</a>. This setting specifically is why the war lasts so long, as it is so difficult to navigate. This story taking place in a continent with many nations, allows for the tensions of a possible mass conflict. Most of <a href="Roshar.html">Roshar</a> is very barren, due to the highstorms. Creating a heavy mood from the landscape. This eeriness adds to dark themes. Such as <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin's</a> death drive, and depression. Or <a href="Dalinar.html">Dalinars's</a> madness, And <a href="Adolin.html">Adolinâ€™s</a> hotheadedness. All of this is propelled by the mood generated from the setting.    </p>

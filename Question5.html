    <h1>Question 5: Analysis of the novle using literary criticism.</h1>
    <p>The Way of Kings is a goldmine when it comes to psychoanalytic analysis. This book feels like <a href="BrandoSando.html">Sanderson</a> Copy and pasted textbook freudian and jungian analysis. The main supply of this “goldmine” is the character <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>, or “Kal.” <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a> starts as a dark, gloomy, depressed character. And grows to become a character full of life, joy, and purpose. Now, I have not finished this book, so I can’t speak a whole lot towards <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a>’s joy, as where i am in this book he is just starting to rediscover purpose. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a>’s story is split into two sections: Before becoming the Bridgeleader of <a href="BridgeFour.html">Bridge Four</a>, and after becoming the Bridgeleader of Bridge Four. </p>
    <h2>Before <a href="BridgeFour.html">Bridge four</a>.</h2>
    <p>Before rediscovering purpose. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> is a character with an intense death drive, and a strong id/superego conflict fueled by the memories of his father. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> is consumed by all of these, and begins to seek out death. Until <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a>, a <a href="Creatures.html">windspren</a>, and <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>’s anima, helps him remember who he is. </p>
    <h3>Death drive and survivors guilt</h3>
    <img src="Wagon.png" alt="wagon" class="Image">
    <p>After trying time and time again to escape his life of slavery, and trying to take care of those around him, <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> loses hope. Kal begins to feel tempted by the embrace of death. This aligns with the Freudian death drive. Where a character begins to fantasize about suicide. Leading to increased aggression, self-destruction, and a dissolution of self. This is seen in <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> in scenes such as the one where he stands at the edge of a plateau on the <a href="Roshar.html">shattered plains</a>. Imagining what it would be like to step off the edge, into the rapid release of death. Or in other scenes where his bitter hatred of his superiors consumes him. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> also gets caught in a repetitive track of blaming himself for all the loss he has experienced, every soldier who fought beside <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a> in his army days, and every slave who worked beside him, and especially his brother <a href="SideChar.html">Tien</a> (who I do not yet know how he died). All of those who <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a> has watched die, kal blames himself. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a> begins to voice all of these feelings, “we exist to be killed, If we are not dead already” (172), or “I’m dead inside, as sure as if I had taken a spear through the neck” (175). This survivor's guilt drives <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> to the point where he no longer has any desire to live.</p>
    <h3>Id vs superego + daddy issues</h3>
    <p>We as the reader quickly discover that <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>’s superego takes the form of the memories of his father. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>’s father was the village doctor in <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>’s hometown. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a>’s father expected Kal to follow in his own footsteps, but <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> always wished to become a soldier. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a>’s father had a strict moral belief that “there are two kinds of people in this world, those who save lives, and those who take them” (171). <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a> spends his days trying to find a gray space in these ethics. Wanting to prove his father wrong, and prove that one can save lives, by taking others. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> continues to be haunted by his fathers words, and his rigid upbringing invoked by his father. <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a>, forced to be a doctor, wanting to be a soldier, forms a distaste for his father and eventually rebels, becoming a soldier. His fathers words form an unfair conscience in his mind. Forming a massive conflict between his id and superego. The battle between his desire, and his intense ideals of right and wrong, rips his character apart, leading him to his lowest point. He is good at fighting, and good at medicine, and tries to find a way to use both of these skills, but is caught in inflicting the same pain he is trying to heal.
        <br><br> In summary all the components of Jungian and Freudian theory seen in Kal at this point are…
        <br><br>Id 	-	Violent instincts, desire for revenge, suicidal fantasy
        <br>Ego	-	Torn identity between soldier and surgeon, killer and protecter
        <br>Superego	-	<a href="SideChar.html">Lirin</a>’s moral code, Judgement, and expectations
        <br>Shadow	 -	 Internalized failures, rage, and guilt
        <br>Trauma	-	<a href="BridgeFour.html">Bridge four</a>, slavery, betrayed by <a href="Brightlord.html">Amaram</a>, <a href="SideChar.html">Tien</a>’s death
    </p>
    <h3><a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a></h3>
    <img src="Syl.png" alt="Syl" class="Image">
    <p>And then comes <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a>, a <a href="Creatures.html">windspren</a>, or at least that's what we as the reader are originally told what she is. But she's not normal, only <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> can see her. And she talks, something that <a href="Creatures.html">spren</a> can’t normally do. <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> in this book serves as <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>’s anima, the physical representation of <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a>’s feminine aspects. Such as intimacy, emotion, sensitivity and inner reflection. In the scene where <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> is about to kill himself and step off the cliff. <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> asks <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> to give it “one more try” (188). She reminds him of all the times he used to take new recruits under his wing and protect them, and asks him to try it one last time. </p>
    <br>
    <img src="TheCliff.png" alt="the cliff" class="Image">
    <p>After this moment, both <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> and <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> begin to change. <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> begins to replace the moral ideals of Lirin, <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a>'s father. Syl becomes Kaladin's new external superego. Where the words of his father were simply “never take a life” and “become a surgeon,” <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> replaces these values with more beneficial ones. Syl urges <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> to prioritize protection over aggression, responsibility over despair, and hope over fatalism. As <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>’s outer conscience, <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> calls out the thing that <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> cannot call out in himself, she questions his anger and bitterness, and gently calls out his hypocrisy. <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> is a very child-like figure, having recently gained consciousness, she is filled with curiosity. I want to learn and understand. This childlike innocence serves as the externalization of <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>’s playfulness and innocence that died with his brother. Instead of seeing the world with despair, she views everything with awe, even death is a curiosity, and a thing she has to learn to understand. <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> helps <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> rediscover joy and purpose. She talks him away from the cliff and <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> begins to remember who he truly is, a protector and a leader. </p>
    <h2>After becoming bridgeleader</h2>
    <img src="BridgeFour.png" alt="Bridgefour" class="Image">
    <p>After leaving the cliff, <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> gives himself the position of bridge leader, which means absolutely nothing. This gives <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> the motivation to protect the others in the <a href="BridgeFour.html">bridge four</a> crew. After becoming the leader of <a href="BridgeFour.html">bridge four,</a> <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> begins to change.</p>
    <h3>Rebuilding of Ego</h3>
    <p>Before, <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>’s ego was fragmented between his desire for revenge, and the peace enforcing rules of his father. Now, <a href="Kaladin.html">Kal</a> begins to rebuild his psyche, redefining his values, with the help of <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a>. shifting to prioritize the protection of those around him. Instead of fighting to hurt the enemy, and medicine to help the friends. He uses both to protect those in his crew. Going out of his way to care for the wounded that would normally have been left on the battlefield to die. No longer is he just a soldier or a medic, now he is a leader and a symbol of hope. </p>
    <h3>The Hero Archetype</h3>
    <p><a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> steps into protecting those around him. Caring for the “Tribe” of <a href="BridgeFour.html">bridge four</a> and putting their lives above his own. His bond with <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> deepens, enforcing the spiritual and psychological unveiling at the heart of his journey. Aligning himself with a deeper sense of wholeness, purpose, and self awareness. <a href="SideChar.html">Syl</a> begins to change forms, alluding to the fact that as <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> continues to awaken, she evolves.    </p>
    <h3>Healing of the death drive</h3>
    <p><a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> stops wishing for the release of death and instead shifts to embracing a life drive. Claiming his will to live and fighting to save and to matter. Overriding the death drive, <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a> starts to find meaning in love, connection, and purpose. This births a leader. One who cares about protecting others, inspiring trust, and giving all the other broken men dignity. 
        <br><br>All this highlights the depth of the redemption arc that the author gives <a href="Kaladin.html">Kaladin</a>. Shifting from seeking death, to life. Revenge, to protection. Isolation, to connection. 
       <br><br> Before <a href="BridgeFour.html">bridge four</a>ss		-		After purpose emerges
        <br>Suicidal, helpless		-		protective, determined
